mendelize.py postprocesses cad.py .g files into a form that works well in the
mendel.

$ mendelize.py hello.g | gcdump

actually, that doesn't work for some reason, though it should. the workaround is:

$ mendelize.py hello.g > hello.mendel

-- open hello.mendel, and copy the entire file
-- run gcdump, which will give you an interactive console to dump gcode into the
   mendel
   
$ gcdump

-- then paste the gcode in there. It'll start going. Woo!
